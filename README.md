# WORK IN PROGRESS!

Features:
 - Enhanced adaptive triggers
 - Biomarker LED 

You need to install this program in order for this to work (Controller emulation + UDP) - https://github.com/WujekFoliarz/DualSenseY

Extract the files from Release.zip in Dying Light 2\ph\work\bin\x64

Launch DSY, go to Emulation tab and select DualShock 4. This is important because otherwise adaptive triggers from the mod will conflict with DL2's native triggers.
